# Potential_Friend_Recommendation_System
In this project, we leveraged the "Twitter Friends" dataset sourced from Kaggle, which you can access through the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hwassner/TwitterFriends.
Our approach involved utilizing Neo4j as the database system to store and manage this data effectively.

We designed and implemented data pipelines to preprocess and load the Twitter Friends dataset into Neo4j, ensuring data integrity and optimal query performance.
Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis to extract valuable insights regarding potential connections based on the number of mutual friends shared between nodes in the network.

This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify and assess potential friendships within the dataset, taking into consideration the degree of mutual connections.
Our findings and conclusions provide valuable insights that can be utilized for various applications, including network growth strategies, targeted outreach, and social network optimization.
